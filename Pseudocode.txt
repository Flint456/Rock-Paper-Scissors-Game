- player starts game

-player chooses either Rock, Paper or Scissors

-At the same time the player makes choice The computer randomly chooses either Rock, Paper or Scissors


if Player Rock & computer Rock 
OR player paper and computer paper 
OR player scissors and computer scissors THEN - TIE

If player Rock & computer scissors  
OR if player player paper & computer Rock 
OR player scissors & computer paper then - WIN

if player Rock & computer paper 
OR player paper & computer scissors 
OR player Scissors & computer Rock then - LOSE

if tie computer outputs "It's a tie! Play again"

if win computer outputs "You Win,(if Rock>Scissors the (Rock beats scissors), if paper > Rock then (paper beats Rock!) if Scissors > Paper then (Scissors beats paper)"

I will need to create a seperate funtion that anounces why you win lose or draw.
